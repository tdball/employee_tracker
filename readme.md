# Employee Tracker

## Project Guidelines
* Restricted to only Google Maps and Leaflet JS
* Develop two identical map implementations using both libraries
* Able to toggle between the both maps without a refresh
* Loads and parses local data.json for dataset
* Validates locations and discards invalid, including bodies of water
* When a marker is clicked, it's name should be displayed.
* Map(s) are to be full screen, with no scrollbars
* If Google Maps is in use Autocomplete Places Search should be available
  * This should remove all existing markers and add place new autocomplete markers
  * Optional, after doing a places search it should reset the markers to the original sites
